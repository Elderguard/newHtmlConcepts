Cybersecurity for ethical hackers is focused on “Blue Team” or “Red Team hackers”, there are various types of hackers and there are different categories for each. Ethical hackers are the ones following the laws and ethics, they do not harm others. The Blue team is the one working on defending the companies and the Red team is the one finding breaches and vulnerabilities and reporting for fixing. I’m currently enrolled in a 3-year college course for cybersecurity. IT has become a passion for me and I would love to share my knowledge with you.</p>
