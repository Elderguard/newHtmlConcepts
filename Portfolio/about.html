Cybersecurity for ethical hackers is focused on “Blue Team” or “Red Team hackers”, there are various types of hackers and there are different categories for each. Ethical hackers follow laws and ethics, causing no harm. The Blue team defends companies, while the Red team finds vulnerabilities, breaches, and reports for fixes. I'm currently enrolled in a 3-year cybersecurity course, and IT has become a passion of mine that I would love to share with you.</p>
